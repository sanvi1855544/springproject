## Overview
- Our spring project is a simple, stripped-down version of a forum site.
- We have 2 easter eggs:
  1) a web version of our old, semi-completed Doodle Jump JFame app
  2) a version of the google dinosaur game
## Runtime Guidelines
- Pull from the main branch
- Run main method in src/main/java/com/example/lobosspring/LobosSpringApplication.java
- Visit localhost:8080 in your browser

## Changelog (Ticket items)
- Some items/changes refer to the same ticket if multiple weeks' worth of progress is for one feature/component (in this case, the ticket should clarify what work was done each week)
- Links to code and runtime evidence are found in the tickets.
